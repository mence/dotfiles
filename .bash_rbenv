# rbenv Setup
# -----------
# This setups rbenv and adds the rbenv shims to your $PATH.
# Make sure you call this at the right point into your .bash_profile to ensure that rbenv is called
# at the right time in your $PATH, particularly if you rely on a system-installed ruby version to
# be in your path.

# Set up rbenv
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
